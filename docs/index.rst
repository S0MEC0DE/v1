OVERVIEW
========================================

SOMECODE is a research platform for serious observation and analysis of Twitter data. SOMECODE brings together 9 years of unbroken continuity in developing social media research tools. Previous tools and processes developed by the contributor team are in daily use by many FORTUNE100 companies and major advertising agencies. SOMECODE is the solution we always wanted to build, but due to the kinds of restraints commercial entities have, never got to. ::

    pip install somecode

All you need to have is Python 2.7 and the somecode installation will take care of all the dependencies. 

BENEFITS
--------

With one command from idea to looking at results of regression analysis, advanced plotting, sentiment analysis, etc. etc.

- Get started with serious social media research in minutes
- Equal or better capabilities vs. best industrial solution
- Up to 10 million tweets per day with single API key
- Optmized for minimizing out-of-scope time use (configuration, data wrangling, etc.)
- Supports both streaming and rest API endpoints for both status (tweet) and user objects
- Provides an ideal environment for academic research and publication

SOMECODE is built by researchers for researchers and is very easy to extend / customize to suit specific needs. For most research scopes SOMECODE will work "out of the box". It has very few depedencies (below) and takes minutes to deploy for your first research project.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

DESKTOP:
........

SOMECODE runs on any regular low-end laptop with a common web browser. Tested on Linux and Mac OS X. Jupyter is highly recommended. 

SERVER/CLOUD:
.............

SOMECODE runs on Amazon Nano (or similar) for $5 per month. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04LTS

For both options::

    pip install somecode 

SOMECODE is very easy to customize / extend if you would feel the need to do it. Even if you are a beginner python learner.

100% fun, 0% mindless wrangling.






Some of the things SOMECODE takes care for you:

- data structures
- datatypes
- character types
- system performance
- API rate-limit management
- JSON parsing
- pipeline process automation
- plot configuration
- exception handling

BUILT ON

Frankly speaking, SOMECODE would not be possible without all the amazing technology solutions it's based on. What SOMECODE does, is put a few key technologies together, with "business logic" that came from working on over a thousand social media research projects since 2005. Somecode uses pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries heavily.

Other than that, dependent on the system, you should have minimal dependencies to worry about. Also if you're not using it already, I highly recommend Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/). It helps make programming much more about fun, and less about frustration.
