# BRIEF BACKGROUND TO SERIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH

In 2009 and 2010 a handful of companies, academic researchers and investors become interested about the idea of using social media data, and particulary Twitter data, for making predictions about real-life events. Some of the early papers covering the topic included work by researchers from Indiana university [1], from STATSIT [2], and from Stanford University [3]. 

By 2011 maybe 10 companies globally were working towards developing serious research capabilities based on social media sampling. Ipsos, Nielsen, etc. were doing what they had always been doing, and then "social media monitoring" or what was still then widely referred to as "sentiment analysis". Brainjuicer is one of the few companies from the traditional research field that has been credited for developing advanved research methods that rely on social media data. While hunderds of social media monitoring and research companies crowded the market place, still today very few social media listening or research company live up to the rigor and standards of the market research industry. 

"Serious social media research" is a term coined by Dr. Deborah Koh, Siim Sainas and Mikko Kotila to describe a method for social media research that address 5 pertinent points: 


#### 1) Data is polluted because of bots / spam / etc. 

#### 2) Rampant sampling violations distort the outputs  

#### 3) Reporting focus on quantity (on the expense of quality)

#### 4) Analysis lack statistical rigor - often merely reporting absolute values

#### 5) Outputs are disconnected from decision making


SOMECODE is based on the "serious social media research" methodology, and is the first comprehensive research suite specifically targeted to meet the needs of the most serious researchers wanting to benefit from social media based samples without all the headaches that come with it. 

SOMECODE is focused on Twitter data, and only Twitter data.

Twitter have been proven to be an effective source of data for analysis and prediction of trends and events. Evidence for successful predictions include movie ratings[1], financial market performance[2], disease outbreaks [3] and likeliness of someone becoming a Jihadist fighter[4]. Among countless other examples where real-life events and trends have been succesfully predicted with Twitter data.
